PROJECT INITIATION

1.1 Define Objectives:

Identify structural breaks in Brent oil prices (1987-2022)

Correlate breaks with historical events

Provide insights for market stakeholders

1.2 Stakeholder Identification:

Energy analysts

Portfolio managers

Policy makers

Academic researchers

DATA PREPARATION PHASE

2.1 Data Acquisition:

Source: Historical Brent crude prices dataset

Period: May 20, 1987 to September 30, 2022

Frequency: Daily closing prices

2.2 Data Quality Assessment:

Check for missing values

Validate date formats

Identify outliers

Verify data completeness

2.3 Event Data Compilation:

Research geopolitical events (wars, conflicts)

Document OPEC decisions (production changes)

Record economic shocks (financial crises)

Minimum: 10-15 key events with dates

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

3.1 Initial Visualization:

Time series plot of raw prices

Distribution analysis

Rolling statistics calculation

3.2 Trend Analysis:

Long-term trend identification

Seasonal decomposition (if applicable)

Multiple time frame analysis (daily, monthly, yearly)

3.3 Stationarity Testing:

Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test

Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test

Differencing requirements assessment

3.4 Volatility Analysis:

Daily returns calculation

Volatility clustering detection

ARCH/GARCH effects testing

Leverage effects examination

MODELING PHASE

4.1 Change Point Model Selection:
