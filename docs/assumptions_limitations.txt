ANALYSIS ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

Date: 2/8/2026

DATA-RELATED ASSUMPTIONS

1.1 Price Data Assumptions:

Daily closing prices accurately reflect market conditions

Data is free from systematic recording errors

USD prices appropriately account for currency fluctuations

All relevant price adjustments are incorporated

1.2 Event Data Assumptions:

Selected events are the most significant market influencers

Event dates accurately reflect market impact timing

Event classifications (geopolitical/economic/OPEC) are appropriate

No major unrecorded events significantly impacted prices

METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS

2.1 Statistical Assumptions:

Time series properties are consistent within regimes

Change points represent true structural breaks

Bayesian priors are appropriately specified

MCMC convergence indicates reliable inference

2.2 Modeling Assumptions:

Change points affect both mean and variance parameters

The number of change points is unknown but finite

Model residuals follow specified distributions

Parameter changes are instantaneous

KEY LIMITATIONS

3.1 Causality Limitation:
CRITICAL NOTE: Correlation ≠ Causation

The most important limitation is the distinction between statistical
correlation and causal impact. Our analysis can identify:

Temporal correlations between events and price changes

Statistical associations between timing and market movements

However, we CANNOT establish:

Definitive causal relationships

Direction of causality

Absence of confounding variables

Counterfactual scenarios

Reasons for this limitation:

Observational data only - no controlled experiments

Multiple simultaneous events often occur

Market anticipation effects (prices move before events)

Unobserved confounding factors

Complex feedback loops in global markets

3.2 Data Limitations:

Period restriction: Data ends September 2022

Frequency limitation: Daily data may miss intraday shocks

Survivorship bias: Only available historical data

Event selection bias: Researcher judgment influences event inclusion

3.3 Model Limitations:

Change point detection sensitivity to parameter choices

Bayesian results depend on prior specifications

Model assumes instantaneous regime changes

Limited ability to detect gradual transitions

Multiple testing concerns with many potential change points

3.4 Interpretation Limitations:

Retrospective analysis only - not predictive

Historical context may not apply to future markets

Global interconnectedness may obscure local effects

Qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model

SPECIFIC CAVEATS

4.1 Temporal Resolution Issues:

Some events may have delayed or anticipatory effects

Gradual policy changes may appear as sudden breaks

Data aggregation may mask short-term volatility

4.2 Market Complexity:

Oil prices influenced by numerous simultaneous factors

Supply-demand dynamics constantly evolving

Speculative trading can obscure fundamental relationships

Long-term trends may dominate short-term events

4.3 External Validity:

Historical patterns may not repeat

Market structure has evolved over 35 years

New factors (renewable energy, EVs) not fully captured

Geopolitical landscape continuously changing

MITIGATION STRATEGIES

5.1 For Correlation/Causation Issue:

Clearly label all findings as correlational

Include explicit disclaimers in reports

Use language like "associated with" not "caused by"

Present multiple potential explanations

5.2 For Model Uncertainty:

Report Bayesian credible intervals

Conduct sensitivity analyses

Compare multiple model specifications

Use model averaging when appropriate

5.3 For Data Limitations:

Acknowledge data constraints upfront

Conduct robustness checks

Use complementary data sources when available

Clearly state temporal boundaries

STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION

6.1 Recommended Language:
Instead of: "Event X caused price change Y"
Use: "Event X coincided with price change Y"
Or: "Statistical evidence suggests association between X and Y"
Or: "Timing correlation observed between X and Y"

6.2 Visual Communication:

Clearly label charts as showing correlations

Include uncertainty intervals on all estimates

Provide context for statistical findings

Avoid definitive causal arrows in diagrams

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

7.1 Responsible Reporting:

Avoid overstating findings

Acknowledge limitations transparently

Consider potential misuse of analysis

Provide balanced interpretation

7.2 Policy Implications:

Analysis should inform, not dictate, policy

Historical patterns inform but don't guarantee future outcomes

Multiple interpretations should be considered

Expert judgment complements statistical analysis

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK

8.1 Methodological Improvements:

Incorporate high-frequency data

Develop causal inference methods

Include macroeconomic variables

Implement machine learning approaches

8.2 Data Enhancements:

Extend time period to present

Add complementary datasets

Include sentiment analysis

Incorporate alternative data sources

CONCLUSION

This analysis provides valuable insights into Brent oil price dynamics
and their temporal association with historical events. However, all
findings should be interpreted with appropriate caution, recognizing
the fundamental limitation that statistical correlation does not
establish causal relationships. The results should be used as one
input among many in decision-making processes.
